# T6 Leveller

**Level your VW T6 anywhere, anytime – precise, fast, and simple.**

**T6 Leveller** is a simple and practical app designed for VW T5/T6 Multivan, California, and Transporter owners to quickly and accurately level their vehicle while camping or parking on uneven ground.

The app uses your phone's gyroscope and accelerometer to display the vehicle's **pitch** (front/back tilt) and **roll** (left/right tilt) in real-time. This makes it easy to level the van using ramps, leveling blocks, or by finding a flat parking spot.

## 🧭 How It Works

- **pitch** – forward/backward tilt

These values are displayed visually, helping you level your vehicle precisely.
